// Build an AI-powered assistant component for my portfolio site.
// The assistant should allow users to ask questions like:
// - "Tell me about your experience"
// - "What projects have you worked on?"
// - "What technologies do you use?"
// - "How can I contact you?"
// The assistant should:
// - Be chat-based with a text input and a response area
// - Use a mock groq API function for now
// - Show loading animation while fetching answer
// - Auto-scroll to latest message
// - Use a clean, responsive design with Tailwind CSS
// - Optional: Support speech-to-text and/or text-to-speech in the future
